# Overview
- Changes are made to post-processing (mostly Ramp Fog and Color Grading), global lighting, individual props and even entire material sets to alter the stage's appearance. For example, the variants included for Titanic Plains are inspired from various trailers - an orange one from very early footage of the game, and an overcast one vaguely similar to the console trailer.
- Once a variant is used, it cannot be chosen for the next time the stage is loaded unless there are no other options. (Configurable)
- Some unused stage props (most notably the border statues in Abandoned Aqueduct) may be enabled.
- The mod currently features **84** visual variants.

# Things have changed
- a lot of commits were made between 1.0 and now and i am not that good at vfx and im not that used to what 1.0 looked like
- please lmk via @pr_d at discord if some variants feel off or things r weird :3

# Shoutouts
- FMRadio11 for the codebase
- SSM24 and Moffein for figuring out the networking ! !
- Nuxlar for a lot of the stages that are on here (SotS)
- Danielle for helping w some variants (SotS)
- Everyone who provided variant ideas (HIFU, FMRadio11, Jaysian, breadguy, Slipskip<!--, &#X48;&#X65;&#X79;&#X69;&#X6D;&#X6E;&#X6F;&#X6F;&#X70;-->). Having existing content to work with is significantly easier even if it's just basic color ideas
